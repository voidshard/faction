	// Populate adds people to an area based on a general 'Demographics' outline.
	//
	// - This is to seed initial populations; people are crafted from thin air.
	// - You can Populate the same area multiple times, this operation is strictly
	// additive.
	// - People are spread evenly over the given areas.
	// - At least one area ID is required.
	// - If you're aiming for unevenly distributed population centres (ie. large cities)
	// then probably you want to call this again for those (or dedicate a call for each).
	// - The people count here is the number of people we want *alive* at the end
	// we can create more people than this; as we sometimes create people dead (as part
	// of a family) in order to simulate some past family tragedy or something.
